# Q-GUIDE WORLD TOUR: WEST WATCH Design

For this project, I wanted to create as seamless of a design as possible. To do this, I implemented many for loops and if statements within my html pages to keep them concise. Additionally, I edited the
branding of the entire webpage to be similarL rounded buttons, similar colors, the same font, etc. When it comes to coding design, I utilized database queries to find data and manipulate the data to output what I needed.
In the evaluation page for example, I created a for loop that went through various range positions to only create one query for each grade, rather than 4 different ones. However, at other times I had to create a new query for
each grade, as seen by the set of "credits" queries at the end of the ww.py page.

I utilized various POST forms for different page routes so that I could have as much interactivity from the user as possible. This allowed me to collect lots of information and send it all to the same place in the ww.py document.
This is the most clear when looking at the schedule() code, where three different POST forms are sent to /myschedule.
Finally, I utlized Javascript and Python extensions within my HTML files to create documents that were maleable and dynamic to each user and their preferences.

Another design choice I made was to have a hover dropdown for the courses, so that I could group them by department and have a sleek look.
